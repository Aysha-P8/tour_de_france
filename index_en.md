Digital Brain A.C is a young start-up specialized in the web and the digital, which is composed of Aicha EZZIKI (project leader, web developer, designer) and of CHloé HENRIQUES (designer, web developer).

We noticed that companies had difficulty finding trainees or work-study students on a synchronized platform. Students also have difficulties finding an internship or training.

Our application "Les compagnons du numérique" (The digital companions) aims to bring together different actors with a common point in the digital professions.
It is a network of mutual aid which allows to create strong links.
But also to propose a personalized training itinerary for students.

With this itinerary simulator, the student will be able to identify the training courses or host companies that interest him/her according to the level of study.

Recruiters will be able to advertise more easily so that they can find a trainee more easily and find the rare pearl!
